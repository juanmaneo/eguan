# io.eguan.vvr.ibs.ibp.path takes a comma-separated list of path for
# cold and immutable IBP data.
#
# The given path list is used to store the raw data and must provide sufficient
# capacity and speed.
#
# - All paths given must point to existing directories that are writable by the
#   user running the vold daemon.
# - Paths must not point to the same directory or sub-directories of each other
#   and have no common sub-directories with
#   io.eguan.vvr.ibs.ibpgen.path, either.
#
# Default value: undefined
# Example: io.eguan.vvr.ibs.ibp.path=/dir1,/dir2
#
io.eguan.vvr.ibs.ibp.path=/tmp/ibsIbp

# io.eguan.vvr.ibs.ibpgen.path takes a path to store hot data and
# persist configuration.
#
# The given path must point to an existing directory where short-lived data and
# persistent configuration will be stored.
# This location must provide moderate capacity but superior performance as 'hot'
# data is temporarily stored for fast low-latency access before being committed
# to slower storage locations pointed to by io.eguan.vvr.ibs.ibp.path.
#
# - The given path must be writable by the user running the vold daemon.
# - For reasons mentioned above, it must not point to the same directory or a
#   sub-directory of any path given under io.eguan.vvr.ibs.ibp.path.
#
# Default value: undefined
# Example: io.eguan.vvr.ibs.ibpgen.path=/some/dir

# io.eguan.vvr.common.device.block.size sets the device block size in
# bytes.
#
# This value determines the block size in bytes used for all devices managed by
# the VVR. All devices and snapshots are built from blocks this size and will
# not function unless the correct value is used.
# A block is used as basic unit of deduplication and it's size must therefore
# be chosen with care.
# Alter only when creating a new VVR from scratch and considering the CPU,
# memory and disk usage implications.
#
# Default value: 4096
# Example: io.eguan.vvr.common.device.block.size = 8192
#
#io.eguan.vvr.common.device.block.size = 4096

# io.eguan.vvr.persistence.nrs.devices.directory defines the relative
# path based on io.eguan.nrs.storage to store
# persistent metadata files associated to devices.
#
# Once set for a given persistent repository, this path is used to reload the
# state from disk and must not have been changed between runs.
# It is recommended to change only if storage volumes and/or
# mount points require it.
#
# Default value: devices
# Example: io.eguan.vvr.persistence.nrs.devices.directory=devices
#
#io.eguan.vvr.persistence.nrs.devices.directory=devices

# io.eguan.vvr.persistence.nrs.snapshots.directory defines the
# relative path based on io.eguan.nrs.storage to store
# persistent metadata files associated to snapshots.
#
# Once set for a given persistent repository, this path is used to reload the
# state from disk and must not have been changed between runs.
# It is recommended to change only if storage volumes and/or

#
# Default value: snapshots
# Example: io.eguan.vvr.persistence.nrs.snapshots.directory=snapshots
#
#io.eguan.vvr.persistence.nrs.snapshots.directory=snapshots

# io.eguan.nrs.images.directory defines the relative
# path based on io.eguan.nrs.storage to store
# persistent metadata files associated to repository block area images.
#
# Once set for a given persistent repository, this path is used to reload the
# state from disk and must not have been changed between runs.
# It is recommended to change only if storage volumes and/or
# mount points require it.
#
# Default value: items
# Example: io.eguan.nrs.images.directory=images
#
#io.eguan.nrs.images.directory=images

# io.eguan.nrs.cluster.size takes the size of clusters
# NRS file data are internally aligned to in bytes.
#
# As with most persistence parameters, it is not recommended to change them
# between runs if existing persistent data is to be reloaded.
# Probable (but unconfirmed) repercussions of changing this value are
# persistent data disk space consumption and/or I/O performance, so change only
# when trying to affect one or both of them.
#
# Default value: 4096
# Minimum value: 1024
# Maximum value: 32768
# Example: io.eguan.nrs.cluster.size=16384
#

# io.eguan.nrs.remaining.space.create.limit defines the
# percentage of storage capacity left on the storage volume used for
# persistence from which the storage provider should refuse to create new
# objects.
#
# This applies to the location set by
# io.eguan.nrs.storage, but any object creation
# within the persistent VVR should raise an error on hitting the given limit.
# Depending on the size of the volume provided to persist VVR data this serves
# as an early warning mechanism to make new item allocation fail way before I/O
# errors start occurring.
#
# Default value: 1
# Minimum value: 0
# Maximum value: 99
# Example: io.eguan.nrs.remaining.space.create.limit=85
#
#io.eguan.nrs.remaining.space.create.limit=1

# io.eguan.filemapping.filemapper denotes the file mapper
# implementation to use.
#
# Choices are between FLAT and DEEP. FLAT provides an identity mapping and
# DEEP adding sub-directories determined by the
# io.eguan.filemapping.dir.structure.depth and
# io.eguan.filemapping.dir.prefix.length values.
#
# Default value: DEEP
# Example: io.eguan.filemapping.filemapper=FLAT
#
#io.eguan.filemapping.filemapper=DEEP

# io.eguan.filemapping.dir.structure.depth is the directory
# structure depth for the DEEP file mapper.
#
# The value set for this key multiplied by the value set for
# io.eguan.filemapping.dir.prefix.length must not exceed the
# length of the string representation of a UUID, i.e. 32.
#
# For example, using default values, the filename
# 8d18c99f7bd044808eb254813a667c79 would be mapped to
# 8d/18c99f7bd044808eb254813a667c79.
#
# Default value: 1
# Minimum value: 1
# Maximum value: 31
# Example: io.eguan.filemapping.dir.structure.depth=4
#
#io.eguan.filemapping.dir.structure.depth = 1

# io.eguan.filemapping.dir.prefix.length is the filename prefix
# length to use for the DEEP file mapper.
#
# The value set for this key multiplied by the value set for
# io.eguan.filemapping.dir.structure.depth must not exceed the
# length of the string representation of a UUID, i.e. 32.
#
# For example, using default values, the filename
# 8d18c99f7bd044808eb254813a667c79 would be mapped to
# 8d/18c99f7bd044808eb254813a667c79.
#
# Default value: 2
# Minimum value: 1
# Maximum value: 31
# Example: io.eguan.filemapping.dir.prefix.length = 4
#
#io.eguan.filemapping.dir.prefix.length = 2

# io.eguan.vvr.ibs.record.execution defines the file path of the
# record file when debugging the ibs. The indicated file must exists and be
# writable to store all calls. The easiest way to use this option is to create
# the file with touch system utility and indicate the full path name of the
# file as the option value.
#
# This option is optional, but if it's set and not valid Ibs will return with
# a configuration error.
#
# by default this option is not activated
# Example: io.eguan.vvr.ibs.record.execution=/tmp/anExistingFile
#io.eguan.vvr.ibs.record.execution=/tmp/anExistingFile

# io.eguan.vvr.ibs.ldb.blocksize defines the block size used by
# levelDB instances within the IBS. This parameter is given using bytes.
#
# default levelDB value: 4096

# interval for levelDB used by the IBS. More details may be found in the
# levelDB documentation.
#
# default levelDB value: 16
# Example: io.eguan.vvr.ibs.ldb.blockrestartinterval=16
#io.eguan.vvr.ibs.ldb.blockrestartinterval=16

# io.eguan.vvr.ibs.ldb.bufferrotationthreshold defines the number of
# record after the IBS will trigger buffer rotation in a given time interval
# This value is only a hint IBS won't block writes to create a new buffer,
# to enhance write performance it's better to increment write buffer size.
# (see other parameters).
#
# Default value: 65536
# Example: io.eguan.vvr.ibs.ldb.bufferrotationthreshold=16384
#io.eguan.vvr.ibs.ldb.bufferrotationthreshold=16384

# io.eguan.vvr.ibs.ldb.bufferrotationdelay defines the time (in
# seconds) after which the IBS will trigger buffer if no write operation
# happens.
#
# Default value: 30
# Example: io.eguan.vvr.ibs.ldb.bufferrotationdelay=16384
#io.eguan.vvr.ibs.ldb.bufferrotationdelay=30

# io.eguan.vvr.ibs.ldb.writedelaythreshold defines the threshold
# in microseconds measured against the number of levelDB instances held by
# the IBS hot data buffer above which write operations are delayed.
#
# if i is the number of levelDB instances, t is the threshold, l the level
# size and d the delay increment defined below, the write delay amounts to
# ( ( i - t ) / l ) * d
#
# Write delays are applied to avoid accumulation of hot data which can't be
# written back to cold storage fast enough. Reasonable values should be chosen
# with the size of hot data storage and available RAM in mind.

# io.eguan.vvr.ibs.ldb.writedelaylevelsize holds the size of one
# level in the write delay process as a number of levelDB instances in hot
# data. For every level in excess of the defined threshold, an additional
# delay is applied to write operations.
#
# Default value: 5
# Example: io.eguan.vvr.ibs.ldb.writedelaylevelsize=3
#io.eguan.vvr.ibs.ldb.writedelaylevelsize=5

# io.eguan.vvr.ibs.ldb.writedelayincrement defines the number of
# milliseconds by which each write operation will be delayed for every level
# above the threshold.
#
# Default value: 10
# Example: io.eguan.vvr.ibs.ldb.writedelayincrement=5
#io.eguan.vvr.ibs.ldb.writedelayincrement=10

#io.eguan.vvr.ibs.dumpAtStopBestEffortDelay=5

# io.eguan.vvr.ibs.autoConfRamSize defines the ram size to use
# in bytes. Recommended value it less than 65% of total ram size.
#
# If not set (or set to 0) will use 65% of total memory.
# For example if the total memory is 8248082432 will use 5361253580.
#
# Default value: 65% of total memory
# Example: io.eguan.vvr.ibs.autoConfRamSize=268435456
#io.eguan.vvr.ibs.autoConfRamSize=8248082432

# io.eguan.nrs.storage defines the path to store
# persistent repository metadata.
#
# Persistent storage for the metadata is used to manage all information on
# snapshots, devices and data blocks associated to them.
# It usually takes less than 1% of the capacity used by raw data

# In the template configuration file, the value must be set to any existing
# directory.
#
# Default value: undefined
# Example: io.eguan.nrs.storage=/another/dir
